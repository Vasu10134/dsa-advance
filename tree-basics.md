# Tree Data Structure (DSA)

## 1. Binary Tree
A **Binary Tree** is a hierarchical data structure in which each node has at most two children, referred to as the **left child** and **right child**. It is commonly used in searching, sorting, and hierarchical representations.

## 2. Root Node
The **Root Node** is the topmost node in a tree. It serves as the starting point of the tree structure, and all other nodes are its descendants.

## 3. Branches
**Branches** refer to the connections between nodes in the tree. These represent the relationship between a parent node and its child nodes.

## 4. Leaf Nodes
**Leaf Nodes** are nodes that do not have any children. They represent the endpoints of a tree structure and are also called **terminal nodes**.

## 5. Left Child
The **Left Child** is the node directly connected to a parent node on the left side in a binary tree. A parent node can have at most one left child.

## 6. Right Child
The **Right Child** is the node directly connected to a parent node on the right side in a binary tree. A parent node can have at most one right child.

## 7. Parent Node
A **Parent Node** is any node that has one or more children. It is the immediate predecessor of its child nodes in the tree hierarchy.

## 8. Sibling Nodes
**Sibling Nodes** are nodes that share the same parent. For example, the left child and right child of a parent node are siblings.

## 9. Levels
The **Level** of a node refers to its position in the tree hierarchy. The root node is at **level 0**, its children are at **level 1**, and so on.

## 10. Subtree
A **Subtree** is a smaller tree that exists within a larger tree. Any node in the tree can act as the root of a subtree.

## 11. Depth
The **Depth** of a node is the number of edges (or steps) from the root node to that particular node. The root node has a depth of 0.

## 12. Preorder Traversal
In **Preorder Traversal**, the nodes are visited in the following order:
1. Visit the root node.
2. Traverse the left subtree.
3. Traverse the right subtree.

## 13. Inorder Traversal
In **Inorder Traversal**, the nodes are visited in the following order:
1. Traverse the left subtree.
2. Visit the root node.
3. Traverse the right subtree.

## 14. Postorder Traversal
In **Postorder Traversal**, the nodes are visited in the following order:
1. Traverse the left subtree.
2. Traverse the right subtree.
3. Visit the root node.
